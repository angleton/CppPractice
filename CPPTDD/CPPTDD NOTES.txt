YouTube video:  
Test-Driven Development (TDD) in C++
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G-QC9ai_u4
From the video:

Test-driven development can be describes using the following steps:
	
	1.  Write a single unit test for a signle piece of the program.
	2.	Run the unit test, expecting it to fail. 
	3.  Write the simplest possible code to pass the unit test.
	4.  Refactor existing code as needed. 
	5.  Repeat steps 2 to 4 until the program is complete. 

If this is running in VS as opposed to VS Code as demonstrated in the video, run the resulting executable. 
The tests won't currently show up in VS's Test Explorer.
